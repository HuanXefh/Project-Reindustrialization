# Project Reindustrialization

![Preview 1](document/doc-preview-1.jpg)

<del>Welcome to Mindustry Educational Edition.</del>

Project Reindustrialization (ProjReind) is a Mindustry mod without tower defense. Instead, the mod brings hardcore production and a hell amount of recipes for Greg's Tech enjoyers.

ProjReind is the improved version of [Reindustrialization](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Reindustrialization) with codes and contents refined. The mod requires [Lovecraftian Library](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Lovecraftian-Library) and [Lovecraftian Laboratory](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Lovecraftian-Laboratory).

Mod features:

- Multi-crafters and a net of recipes based on real life counterparts.

- Peaceful sectors (at most time) with mass production as the only objective.

- Tech tree with style entirely distinct from vanilla Mindustry.

- Various mechanics including corrosion and pollution.

If you'd like to report bugs or share ideas, please submit issues at [Lovecraftian Library](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Lovecraftian-Library) where majority of the scripts are written, or go to the [Discord forum](https://discord.com/channels/391020510269669376/1346118807734845440).
