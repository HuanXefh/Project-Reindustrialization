Project Reindustrialization (ProjReind) is a Mindustry mod without tower defense. Instead, the mod brings hardcore production and a hell amount of recipes for Greg's Tech enjoyers.

ProjReind is the improved version of [Reindustrialization](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Reindustrialization) with codes and contents refined. The mod requires [Lovecraftian Library](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Lovecraftian-Library) and [Lovecraftian Laboratory](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Lovecraftian-Laboratory).

Mod features:

- Multi-crafters and a complex net of recipes based on real-life processes.

- Peaceful sectors (at most time) with mass production as the only objective.

- Tech tree with style entirely distinct from vanilla Mindustry.

- Various mechanics including corrosion and pollution.
